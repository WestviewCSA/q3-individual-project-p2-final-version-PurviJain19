What question(s) did you generate that can be better (get to real answers or understanding) by rewording them to be open-ended or closed? 

- For QUESTION #10, I think it can be better generated to get more useful explanation and I think it should be a open ended question 
  because Mr. David can go through the text map output and input formating from the textbook or through a quick demo.
